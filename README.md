# Clean And Responsive Start Page

This is just a basic, clean start page. Some of the look and feel was inspired by other start pages that were posted to reddit's r/startpages. 

The goal here was to make a clean page, that had what I needed/used most as the focus, while still having a little extra. I also wanted to make it more mobile friendly than the default safari start page (yes, I'm an iPhone and Mac user).

Feel free to download the source and use it yourself if you like it. If you notice any bugs that are not listed below, please notify me.

# Known Bugs
- Sometimes the weather doesn't load, or takes a long time to load
- Transitions between mobile/desktop views sometimes break, leaving the screen a bit of a mess
- ~~When hovering over a link, there is a strange blue tick-mark on the text~~
